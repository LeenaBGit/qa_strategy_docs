## 1. Objective

To validate that the Invoice Generation module accurately generates invoices based on input data, applying correct formatting, business rules, taxes, and discounts before sending them to clients or systems.

---

## 2. Scope

### ‚úÖ In-Scope:
- Manual creation of invoices via UI
- Auto-generation of invoices from scheduled jobs
- Field validation (e.g., amounts, customer info)
- PDF generation
- Email dispatch confirmation
- Integration with billing and tax systems

### ‚ùå Out-of-Scope:
- Payment processing (covered in Payment module)
- External tax engine testing

---

## 3. Test Items

- Invoice creation form (UI)
- Scheduled batch invoice job
- PDF invoice rendering
- Invoice status updates
- Logs & audit trail
- API for invoice creation (if available)

---

## 4. Entry Criteria

- All blockers from previous sprint resolved

---

## 5. Exit Criteria

- All planned test cases executed
- No high/critical bugs open
- Regression passed
- UAT feedback incorporated

---

## 6. Test Design Techniques

- Equivalence Partitioning (valid/invalid input fields)
- Boundary Value Analysis (amount limits, date ranges)
- State Transition (draft ‚Üí approved ‚Üí sent)
- Error Guessing (missing tax ID, null amounts)

## 11. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API for tax not ready | Mock API or delay testing |
| PDF layout changes last minute | Validate layout using early drafts |
| Email server not configured | Use local mail capture tool |
